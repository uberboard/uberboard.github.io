After extracting the files into a directory of your choice, you will need to add the directory to your system's PATH variable to ensure the executable can be found by your shell.
Here's how you can do this on Windows, Linux, and MacOS:

### Windows
1. Right-click on 'This PC' or 'My Computer' and select 'Properties'.
2. Click on 'Advanced system settings' and then 'Environment Variables'.
3. Under 'System Variables', find the PATH variable and select it. Click 'Edit'.
4. In the 'Edit Environment Variable' window, click 'New' and add the path to the directory where you extracted the files.
5. Click 'OK' to close each window.


### Linux and MacOS
1. Open a terminal.
2. Determine which shell you are using by running ```echo $SHELL```.
3. Based on your shell, edit the appropriate configuration file in your home directory (```~/.bashrc```, ```~/.zshrc```, etc.) by adding the following line:
    ```bash copy
    export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/directory
    ```

4. Replace ```/path/to/your/directory``` with the actual path to the directory where you extracted the files.
5. Save the file and reload the configuration by running source ```~/.bashrc``` (or the equivalent for your shell).

By following these steps, you ensure that the ```uberboard``` executable is accessible from anywhere in your terminal.
