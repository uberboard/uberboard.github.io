# Getting Started with ```uberboard```
This guide will walk you through the basic steps to set up your own uberboard dashboard, create a view, and configure a shipper to manage data flow.

<Steps>
### Install ```'uberboard CLI'```
If you haven't already installed the uberboard-cli tool, you can do so by
running the following command in your terminal:

```bash copy
curl -o- https://uberboard.io/install.sh | bash
```

This command downloads and runs the installation script from the official uberboard.io website, setting up the uberboard CLI tool on your system.

### Initialize Your Dashboard
Once the ```uberboard``` is installed, you can initialize a new dashboard project by running:

```bash copy
uberboard dashboard create my-dashboard
```

Replace ```'my-dashboard'``` with your desired project name. This command creates a new directory with the necessary files to get started with your dashboard.

### Create a View
A view in ```uberboard``` represents a specific layout or part of your dashboard that displays widgets or data elements. To create a new view, use the uberboard CLI again:

```bash copy
uberboard views create my-view
```

Replace ```'my-view'``` with a name for your view. After creating the view, you can configure it by adding widgets or specifying data sources.

### Configure a Shipper
Shippers are responsible for collecting, processing, and sending data to your dashboard.
To set up a shipper, you'll need to configure it based on your data source and requirements. This
typically involves editing a configuration file or using the uberboard-cli to specify data sources, formats, and other settings.

```bash copy
uberboard shippers create my-shipper
```

### Add Shipper And View To Your Dashboard
With your view created and shipper configured, you're now ready to use it in your dashboard. Edit ```dashboard.hbs```
in the root of your dashboard folder and add the following line:

```html copy
<div data-widget data-view="my-view" data-shipper="my-shipper"></div>
```

### Start Your Dashboard
With your view created and shipper configured, you're now ready to start your dashboard:

```bash copy
uberboard start
```

This command launches your dashboard, making it accessible for you to view and interact with the data and widgets you've configured.
</Steps>

## Conclusion
You've now set up a basic dashboard with uberboard, including a custom view and a data shipper. For further customization and advanced features, refer to the official uberboard documentation.
